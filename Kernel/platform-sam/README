Sam Coupe prototyping and 32K/32K split development work

Proposed memory layout

Kernel mode

0-7FFF		Kernel in bank 2/3
8000-FFFF	Kernel in bank 0/1

Video

0-5FFF		Frame buffer (mode 3)	bank 4/5
6000-6FFF	Font
7000-7EFF	Free
7F00-7FFF	Copy of high page in case want video high for some cases
8000-FFFF	Kernel in bank 0/1

User Space

0000-00FF	Thunking code
0100-7FFF	User page
8000-FCFF	User page
FD00-FEFF	UDATA stash
FF00-FFFF	Thunking code

Extmem support would require extra work and separate high/low pools for
the bank allocator

User Copies

0000-7FFF	User bank for copy
8000-FFFF	Kernel in bank 0/1

Forking

Need to look at the TRS80m1 hack which might actually be faster than ldir
and all the bank juggling tricks

Stub code is in the low parts of the low banks and the top of the high banks
so we have two copier routines one for each half.

	-	Fix signal handling crashes
	-	Sometimes we seem to pre-empt in the middle of a pre-empt
		and crash ?? we see a kprintf from an interrupt interrupted
		Need to check all our IRQ save/restore logic is sound on
		video especially !
	-	AtomIDE detect fails if ROM present (select dev 0 first ?)
DONE	-	Run out of pages - suggests child exit/bank32 isn't cleaning
		up right
DONE	-	Move fonts to video bank after frame buffer
	-	Floppy driver (at least for read)
DONE	-	Get to init (but not much further)
IP	-	Debug all the new banking code and stubs
	-	Atom IDE driver
DONE	-	Atom-lite IDE driver
DONE	-	Look at how to preserve high colour bits

	-	RTC driver
	-	Serial driver
	-	Mouse/Joystick/Input

	-	Mode setting/graphics mode support
	-	Video ioctls
	-	UDG ioctls
	-	Is there any way to do video mapping into user process sanely
		(probably not)

	-	Sound

IP	-	MegaRAM (as RAMdisc)

	-	Maybe look at a 16K boundary aware allocator to get better
		memory packing - but it's really hairy.

	-	Less interrupt masking (but the banking logic makes it really
		foul especially as we don't have proper IM2 support)

	-	Maybe look at the modern add ons (SD card, network etc)

Boot from the created floppy .mgt file
Disable atomlite boot rom (need to fix that issue)
Filesystem on Atomlite. If using simcoupe dd it 534 bytes into the image
Select device 0 for boot to get atomlite (you can do partitions)
