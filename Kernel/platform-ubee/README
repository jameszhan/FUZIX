Memory Map:

First 64K

	0000-00FF		Vectors
	0100-01FF		Free
	0200-wherever		Kernel
	DB00			Discard
	E400			Common
	F000			Video

(this will change once the video code is reworked to be)

	0000-0100		Vectors
	0100-0200		Free for now (IRQ stack ?)
	0200-wherever		Kernel
	wherever		Discard (turned into buffers)
	F400			Common & Video

	(Video overlaid temporarily on 8000-8FFF)

The other memory is then overlaid on 0000-7FFF for user space

	0000-00FF		Vectors
	0100-7CFF		Application
	7D00-7FFF		Udata/stack cache (may be able to move
				oto 7DFF/7E00)

Done so far:

- Bootloader. Loads the image into 0200 using the ROM and runs it
- Code to generate an SS80 bootable disk image
- Basic initialization and setup, video and machine type probing
- Sketch of various drivers
- Basic floppy driver code

To Do:
- Floppy - media detect/sectors per track etc
- Try mounting a file system on floppy
- Debug TC keyboard code: shift/ctrl are busted - do we need repeat ?
- Hard disk driver debug
- Bank the video
- Get init loading, load and test userspace
- IDE driver (note the ubee512 emulator ide appears to be very busted as
  on 5.8.0)
- How to tell wd1010 system from 2793 from both with 0x58 switch
	-	Select 0x58 = 0
		See if track register writes to values
		See if it changes when we flip 0x58 (try several cases)
		Y = has 0x58 switch
	-	WD 2793 has a track register we can play with which is
		mirrored on the ubee 4 registers down I think
	-	WD1010 has lots more registers

	Algorithm therefore is

	Write 0x45 (mirrrored track) Read back at 0x41/0x45 a few times

	If it mirrors to 0x41 then it's a 2793
	If it writes/reads back but does not mirror it's a WD1002-5

	Now check if writes to 0x45 affect 0x5 with 0x58 switched
	(if so its two controllers and we can repeat the probe algorithm
	for the other one)

	Finally check 0x48 on the floppies. If it has low bits set then
	it's a dream disk or if setting bits is reflected back it's a dream
	disk. So set bit 3 (DD), read back. 0x80 -> normal else DD

	*Never write 0x41 while probing as it's precomp on the WD. 0x45
	however is either cyl_high or track_w so safe

- If we have wd1002-5 and fd wtf do we put IDE in major/minors ?

Longer Term
- Support attributes, colour, RAM based fonts (load the ROM one into RAM
  customised for bold/italic ?)
- Hardware 6x45 scrolling
- Do delayed video output via a buffer off vblank event for non premium
- Non TC keyboard (lightpen keyboard)
- Proper support for Z80 PIO interfaces
- Z8530 SCC
- Graphics not just vt interfaces
- Maybe eventually switch to soft interrupt model and support soft serial
  interrupts (ick)


Notes:

The Microbee disk systems do various early magic and then end up in the copy
of the boot rom with rom services at E000-EFFF and using DE00-DFFF for data.
(paging register is 0x04). Disk track 0 side 0 sector 1 is loaded at $80 and
then executed from $80.

At this point you have use of the ROM services and can load more data. The
firmware routine loads sequential sectors without software skew loading in
sector order then the next track same side. It seems to check for unknown
sectors so probably works for any sector count.

Disk formats DS40, SS80 are nothing unusual (40 track or 80 track 512 bytes
per sector) but store 10 sectors per track. They are soft skewed by the OS
usually.

DS80 is weird. Tracks 0/1 behave as expected but the sectors on a DS80 for
the later tracks are numbered 21-30. The emulator only stores those sectors
so you can't use this for sane stuff

DS82 is like DS80 but without the weird skew and only 1 system track for CP/M

Fuzix should probably default to 9 sectors/track for compatibility with other
platforms, but offer switches for 10 sec and density/side detect.

(General question - should we add geometry hints to the superblock - we have
room)

There are three kinds of video

Standard:
	A 6545 with 2K of display memory and 128 8x16 ROM characters plus
	128 in programmable character memory. No colour

Premium:
	The 6545 has
	2K character memory
	2K attribute memory
	2K colour memory
	up to 4 banks of programmable character memory

256TC:
	The 6545 has
	2K character memory
	2K attribute memory
	16K PCG ram (up to 32K supported)



High resolution video is sort of MSX like but cruder. The character memory is
filled with unique character codes and the character ram is loaded with the
bit patterns.
