CPUINFO(1)
## NAME
*cpuinfo* - display information about the processor(s) in use
## SYNOPSIS
*cpuinfo* \[-p port\]
## DESCRIPTION
The *cpuinfo* command displays available information about the processor.
The information displayed and the detail level is dependant upon the
processor itself, and what identication facilities are available.

For some processors such as the Z80 it is necessary to provide a suitable
I/O port for parts of the identification. For a Z80 system this should be a
port which can be written and reads back the same value while not having any
immediate side effect. The command will restore the port state.

## STANDARDS
cpuinfo is a Fuzix specific command
